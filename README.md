This is a project comparing different (classification) algorithms for the sentiment analysis of movie reviews:

* Gaussian: A probabilistic classifier based on gaussian_classify distribution
* KNN: K-Nearest-Neighbour classifier
* MLP: Mulit-layer Perceptron

Both classifiers are using the TIMIT Corpus.
